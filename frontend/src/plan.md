# Comprehensive Plan for Addressing Login Issues

## Plan:

1. **Update `Login.jsx`**:
   - Ensure that the login logic correctly handles the redirection for staff and TPO users after a successful login.
   - Improve error handling to provide more specific feedback if the login fails, particularly for staff and TPO roles.

2. **Verify `auth.controller.js`**:
   - Check that the backend correctly processes staff and TPO logins and returns appropriate responses. Ensure that the user roles are correctly assigned and that the JWT token is generated without issues.

3. **Enhance `ErrorBoundary.jsx`**:
   - Modify the error message displayed to the user to provide more context or guidance, especially for staff and TPO logins. This could include suggestions for troubleshooting or contact information for support.

## Follow-up Steps:
- Test the login functionality for all user roles (student, staff, TPO) to ensure that the redirection works as expected and that error messages are informative.
- Review the console logs for any errors that may arise during the login process.
